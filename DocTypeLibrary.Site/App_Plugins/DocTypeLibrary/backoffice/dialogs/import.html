            Import Doctype

            <p>
                We will read a github repo, or local folder
                to get doctypes you can import, we might 
                have to impliment a tree view so you can pick
                them - maybe an import folder
            </p>

            <p>
                We will also need to consider how we check for datatypes
                and do we create missing datatypes and where ?
